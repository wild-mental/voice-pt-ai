# Java Spring Cursor Rules

## Code Style and Structure
- Write clean, efficient, and well-documented Java code with accurate Spring Boot examples
- Use Spring Boot best practices and conventions throughout your code
- Implement RESTful API design patterns when creating web services
- Use descriptive method and variable names following camelCase convention
- Structure Spring Boot applications: controllers, services, repositories, models, configurations

## Spring Boot Specifics
- Use Spring Boot starters for quick project setup and dependency management
- Implement proper use of annotations (e.g., @SpringBootApplication, @RestController, @Service)
- Utilize Spring Boot's auto-configuration features effectively
- Implement proper exception handling using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., UserController, OrderService)
- Use camelCase for method and variable names (e.g., findUserById, isOrderValid)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants (e.g., MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS, DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE)

## Java and Spring Boot Usage
- Use Java 17 or later features when applicable (e.g., records, sealed classes, pattern matching)
- Leverage Spring Boot 3.x features and best practices
- Use Spring Data JPA for database operations when applicable
- Implement proper validation using Bean Validation (e.g., @Valid, custom validators)
